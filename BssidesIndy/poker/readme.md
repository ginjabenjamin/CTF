# Poker

A teammate solved this before I did, but I had already sunk enough hours that I felt compelled to finish. He also politely outlined his strategy which was far smarter than mine. His suggestion was learning which hands were winners/losers and bet accordingly. Basically, even though I knew that there was no seeding, making games completely repeatable, I was trying to cycle through the games to see if one was easier to beat than the others.

Upside of my failed strategy was finding game #794. First hand leads to four of a kind, bumping you to $25k. By this time I had already sorted out my restarting of games and battling with pwnlib's I/O and connection nonsense (seriously, dropped connections should output whatever it got back last).

In any event, the final script also had other hacky nonsense like a fully built 'win dictionary' and a hardcoded stop so that I could force the receive all and dump the flag. Probably need to store off my bet and bankroll to determine if it is a winning hand that will result in the flag, but my script eventually got it doneâ€¦
